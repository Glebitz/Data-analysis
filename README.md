# E-commerce users analysis

Using raw data from e-commerce I analysed users' behavior: number of purchases, most popular weekdays, visualized some data. Carried out cohort and RFM analysis.
Technology Stack: Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, datetime), Git. \
As a result I found out that: \
  1. Most of the customers have only 1 purchase. \
  2. Some of the orders were canceled or not available due to technical issues. \
  3. Different goods have their own 'favorite' weekdays when they are popular among customers. \
  4. Cohort analysis: retention rate for all the cohorts is less than 1%.
